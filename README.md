# CutUpMachine
This archive contains Adobe Flash code and supporting files for a website I made in 2010 that enables users to create their own cut-ups (see cut-up technique popularized by William Burroughs) using RSS feeds as source material.
The feeds stopped working when Yahoo Pipes ended, but can be fixed.
If you make something cool out of this please let me know.
Have fun.
